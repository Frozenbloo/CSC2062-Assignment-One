    "## Function Definitions\n",
    "After loading each CSV image into a NumPy array, I computed the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t`nr_pix`: The total number of black pixels, calculated by taking the sum of all values in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t`rows_with_1` and `cols_with_1`: The counts of rows and columns, respectively, that contain exactly one black pixel. I achieved this by summing along each row, or column, and counting how many of these equal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\t`rows_with_3p` and `cols_with_3p`: The number of rows and columns that contain three or more black pixels. This was achieved in a similar fashion to calculating rows and columns with one pixel, but instead, by counting how many are greater than or equal to three.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\t`aspect_ratio`: Using NumPy’s argwhere function, which finds the indices of array elements that are non-zero grouped by element, I was able to calculate the minimal bounding box around the symbol. The aspect ratio was then calculated as the width divided by the height of the bounding box, capturing the overall shape of the symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\t`neigh_1`: I implemented a helper function, “count_neighbours”, to count the 8-connected neighbours for a pixel. I then iterated through every pixel, tallying the number of black pixels that had exactly one black neighbour.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\t**Directional Isolation Features**:\n",
    "•\t`no_neigh_above`, `no_neigh_below`, `no_neigh_left`, `no_neigh_right`: For each black pixel, I examined the immediate neighbours in the specified directions using a sliding window approach and counted those pixels that had no adjacent black pixels in that region.\n",
    "•\t`no_neigh_horiz` and `no_neigh_vert`: These features aggregate the isolation checking by only checking the black neighbours on both the left and right, or top and bottom, simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\t`connected_areas`: To calculate this feature, I used an 8-connected neighbourhood- defined using SciPy’s “generate_binary_structure(2, 2)” – to determine connectivity between pixels. This means that any two foreground pixels with value 1 are considered connected if they are adjacently horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The “nd_label” function then labels each unique connected component. I then calculated the total number of these labels, which represents the number of connected areas in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\t`eyes`: According to the assignment specification, an “Eye” is a region of whitespace that is completely surrounded by lines of the character. To compute this, I started by inverting the binary image so that white becomes 1, and black becomes 0. I then applied connected component analyses, as seen in connected_areas, but instead using a 4-connected structure. I then counted the connected white regions that do not touch the image border, as these represent truly enclosed regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\t`custom - Normalised Horizontal Symmetry`: Initially, I was planning on using the Euler number as my custom feature, however I found it to be too similar to the eyes feature, so I decided to base my custom feature on horizontal symmetry. I started by calculating the symbols bounding box, as seen in the aspect_ratio feature, and then calculating the midpoint column. I then flip the right half of the bounding box horizontally and calculate the absolute differences between the left and right halves. This value is then normalised by the total number of pixels in the halves to yield a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect symmetry. Additionally, to handle edge cases, I return a default score of 1.0, under the assumption that insufficient width implies a lack of asymmetry.\n",
